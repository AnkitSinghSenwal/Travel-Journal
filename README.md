# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Setup

`npm install`
This command installs all the dependencies specified in the dependencies and devDependencies sections of your package.json file.

`npm run dev`
This command starts the development server, often providing features like hot module replacement (HMR), live reload, and detailed error messages.
The project will open at - http://localhost:5173/Travel-Journal/


`npm run build`
This command compiles the project, generating optimized files typically located in a dist or build directory.
This executes the script defined as "build" in the scripts section of package.json.
It is used to compile, bundle, and optimize the project for production deployment.
